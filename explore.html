          Swaraj Dweep, India

        <p>This far-flung island paradise is part of the chain of Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It's not easy to reach, but it's worth the trip for anyone who craves sugar-white beaches, aquamarine waters, and snorkeling far, far from the big tourist crowds. Swaraj Dweep, formerly known as Havelock Island, is a great getaway for a tropical idyll that is completely off the grid. For true paradise among the palm trees, head to the translucent turquoise waters of Radhanagar Beach at sunset.</p> -->

          Egremnoi, Greece
          
        </li>

        <p>It's hard to find a beach on Lefkada Island that doesn't have spectacular views of the crystal-clear Ionian Sea, but Egremnoi (or Egremni) on the west coast is particularly stunning. Reaching the sand requires a steep hike down a long set of stairs, but you'll enjoy the view the whole way down. You will have to climb back up eventually, but it's worth it to spend all day swimming in the turquoise waters and sunning on the sugar-white sand — just remember to bring along a good pair of swim goggles.</p>
        <li>Crater Lake, Oregon
       </li>

     <p>The deep blue waters that fill the caldera of the sunken volcano Mount Mazama make Crater Lake one of America's most beautiful lakes. There are no incoming streams or rivers to interfere with the clarity of the lake, the deepest in all of the United States at 1,943 feet. Visit this national park in Oregon to walk along the Rim Trail, where you'll be able to appreciate the natural wonder, but know that swimming is allowed only at the access point on the Cleetwood Cove Trail, which opens in late June.</p>

          Blue Lagoon, Portland, Jamaica

        <p>Many legends have surrounded this enigmatic lagoon in Jamaica, from tall tales of resident dragons to rumors that it is bottomless — although its depth of about 200 feet has been confirmed. Still, all agree it is one of the most beautiful places in Jamaica because it boasts some of the clearest water in the world. The lagoon, just east of Port Antonio, is a perfect place to explore and recharge. The water's color can range in shade from turquoise to royal blue depending on the time of day, and the lake is fed by a mix of underground freshwater springs and saltwater from the Caribbean Sea.</p>

          Devil’s Bay, Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands

        <p>Sometimes it feels like the best views are the ones you have to work for, and it does take some work to get to Devil's Bay on Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands. After you scrabble through the gem-colored Baths, a scenic point where large boulders form picturesque caves, you'll emerge on the tiny, picture-perfect slice of white sand known as Devil's Bay. Pack your snorkel and enjoy the clear turquoise Caribbean waters.</p>
        
        <li> Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia
        </li>
        <img src="plitvice-lakes-croatia-BLUEST1216-2511816e03464350971986e2faeaf624.webp">
        <p>A two-hour drive from the industrial capital city of Zagreb lies a natural wonder in the middle of Croatia— Plitvice Lakes National Park. A UNESCO World Heritage site since 1979, this forest is covered with 16 turquoise blue lakes and the innumerable waterfalls that connect them. A wooden walkway winds through the park's upper and lower lakes giving visitors the chance to wander alongside and even over the tops of crystalline lakes and waterfalls. Swimming is not allowed in the lakes, but with the beaches of the Dalmatian Coast not too far away, you should still pack your swimsuit.</p>
